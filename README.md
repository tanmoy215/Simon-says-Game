ðŸš€ Just Built a Simon Says Game with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! ðŸŽ®

Excited to share my latest projectâ€”a classic Simon Says Game built entirely from scratch! I took on this project to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation while having a bit of fun along the way.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
JavaScript: Used for game logic and event handling.
HTML & CSS: Provided structure, design, and responsive styling for an engaging user experience.
ðŸŽ‰ Features
Randomized Color Sequences that the user must match.
Visual Feedback: Each button lights up, and there's a "game over" animation if the sequence is incorrect.
Score Tracking: Tracks the highest score, encouraging users to beat their personal best!
ðŸŒ± What I Learned
Working on this project taught me a lot about:

Event listeners and managing asynchronous effects like button flashing.
Responsive Design in CSS to make the game look good on both mobile and desktop screens.
Array manipulation and comparison for managing game sequences in JavaScript.
Feel free to check out the code on my GitHub: GitHub Repository Link or reach out if you have feedback. Iâ€™m excited to keep building and learning! ðŸ’»âœ¨
